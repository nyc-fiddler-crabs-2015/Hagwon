# Review

## Startup

* Seems to have worked.  yay.
* Signin seems to have worked.  yay

## Test

* Given that you have a traditional Rails app, I think that the testing is a little lite.  Things you should look into implementing
  * FactoryGirl for factories
  * More robudst controller tests

## Migrations

Good


## UX

Make sure your log in lets me use TAB to navigate and that return doesn't loop
me back to refreshing the page

## Assets

Don't include the entire jQuery ui toolkit
